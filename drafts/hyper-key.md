Have you ever noticed that no app binds a default keyboard shortcut to shift+control+option+command+whatever?
That means you have a potential global keybinding prefix that will never have any conflicts!
[Brett Terpstra calls this the hyper key](https://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/).
I like that!

Since this is hard to hit (which, well, that's why nobody uses it by default) I have this bound to [a special key on my Kinesis](https://gist.github.com/BrianHicks/26b5c7739d909061f91432bd78897218).
Here are some goodies I get:

- hyper + arrow: move a window to the left/top/right/bottom half of my screen with [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/)
- hyper + space: open [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/)' quick input
- hyper + semicolon: open Things' [quick input with autofill](https://culturedcode.com/things/mac/help/things-sandboxing-helper-things3/)
- hyper + j: open the link for my next meeting with [Next Meeting](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/next-meeting/id1017470484?mt=12)
- hyper + enter: jump to [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)
- hyper + ': jump to [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)

There are a few more I have bound (fullscreen, middle-of-screen shortcuts) but those are the main ones.
I've found them really handy over the years.
Let me know if you have any really good ones for yourself!
