Have you ever noticed that no app is brave/foolish enough to bind a default keyboard shortcut to shift+control+option+command+whatever?
That means you have a global keybinding prefix that will basically never have any conflicts!
[Some people](TODO: Brett Terpstra link?) call this the hyper key.
I like that!

Since this is hard to hit (which, well, that's why nobody uses it by default) I have this bound to a special key on my Kinesis (TODO: link config)
Here are some goodies I get:

- hyper + arrow: move a window to the left/top/right/bottom half of my screen with [Divvy](TODO link)
- hyper + space: open [Things](TODO: link)' quick input
- hyper + semicolon: open Things' [quick input with autofill](TODO: link)
- hyper + j: open the link for my next meeting with [Next Meeting](TODO: link)
- hyper + enter: jump to [Dash](TODO: link)
- hyper + ': jump to [iTerm2](TODO: link)

There are a few more I have bound (fullscreen, middle-of-screen shortcuts) but those are the main ones.
I've found them really handy over the years.
Let me know if you have any really good ones for yourself!
