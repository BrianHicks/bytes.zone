I keep using the term "clown computing" in conversations but I've never defined it.

Clown computing is a riff on "cloud computing", but instead of provisioning your software according to high availability or other actual reasonable architectural principles, you just put as much software on a single cloud VM as you can.

Like a clown car.
Get it?
