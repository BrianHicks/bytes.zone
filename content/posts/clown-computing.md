I keep using the term "clown computing" in conversations but I've never defined it.

Clown computing is a riff on "cloud computing", but instead of provisioning your software according to high availability or other actual reasonable architectural principles, you just stuff as much software as you can into a single cloud VM.

Like a clown car.
Get it?
